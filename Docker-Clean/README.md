# Docker Clean

Copy this function to the end of your .bashrc or .zshrc file to run it from any console path.
Be careful because it does not ask for confirmation and will remove any trace of Docker container, image, network interface or volume.

**USE:** From any console type:
`cleanDocker`

**NOTE:** Yes, I know the "prune" command... ðŸ˜‰
